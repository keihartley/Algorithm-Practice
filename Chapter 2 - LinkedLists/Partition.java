// Description: Problem 2.3, page 94 of the book

// Problem: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x
// come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. (IMPORTANT: The partition element x can appear
// anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right
// partitions. The additional spacing in the example below indicates the partition. Yest, the
// outputs below is one of many valid outputs!)
